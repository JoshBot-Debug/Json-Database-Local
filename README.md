# Json-Database-Local

This project is still under development.

Save a Database offline and generate a .json file with all the data. This is damn useful if you want to develope a React.js website totally static using .json to save some data. You will be able to manage the Json file like a database.

# How to install

Inside the ./dist you will find the wheel file, install wheel using pip "pip install wheel". After that, copy the .whl file to the folder where you want to install the package in and run the command "pip install jsonDB-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl"

# How to use

Check out the "externalProj.py" file, you will find out how to get started there, there are more ways to use the database application other than what I wrote in the "externalProj.py" file, hopefully you've worked with databases in the past and recognize the method names and what they are supposed to do.
